# Python Techdegree: Object-Oriented Python
Sometimes simple scripts with functions in them just aren't enough.

Eventually you'll need logical models of your work and that'll lead you to creating custom classes in Python.

Object-oriented programming is a large topic. It provides us some amazing tools, though, so it's one of the most beneficial things to learn about in Python.

First, you'll learn how to build basic custom classes. Then, you'll expand them through inheritance. And for some extra power, you'll also learn how to take control of Python's built-in classes to make your own more powerful while doing less work. Finally, we'll put everything together into a fun game utility.

What you'll learn

    * Object-oriented programming
    * Inheritance
    * Special methods
