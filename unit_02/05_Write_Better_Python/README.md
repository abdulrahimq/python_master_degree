We've learned the ins and outs of Python. We're comfortable making all sorts of data types, writing functions, and creating classes.

But now we need to look at how our Python code should be formatted so it matches the standard.

We'll also look at how to get our code to give us help() and how we can use logging and pdb to help us keep track of what's going on inside the code.

What you'll learn

    * The Python style guide and Zen rules
    * Docstrings
    * Logging
    * The Python Debugger
