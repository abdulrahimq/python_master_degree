# Python Techdegree: Python Collections
We can get pretty far in Python with numbers, strings, lists, booleans, and basic logic.

![](../art/courses/python_collections.png?raw=true)

Eventually, though, we're going to need more complex containers for our data. We're also going to need more control over lists and strings. In Python Collections, I'll teach you about dictionaries, sets, tuples, slices, and how to exert even more control over lists in your Python programs!

What you'll learn

    * Lists
    * Dictionaries
    * Tuples
    * Sets
    * Variable packing and unpacking
