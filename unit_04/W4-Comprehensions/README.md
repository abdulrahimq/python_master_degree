![](banner.png?raw=true)

Comprehensions are a convenient way to work with iterables in Python. Comprehensions let you skip the for loop and start creating lists, dicts, and sets straight from your iterables. Comprehensions also let you emulate functional programming aspects like map() and filter() in a more accessible way. Come learn a great way to make your code cleaner, smaller, and more Pythonic with list, dict, and set comprehensions!
