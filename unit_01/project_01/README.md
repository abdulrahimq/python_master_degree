# Treehouse Python Techdegree: Project 1
![](cover.png?raw=true)

In this project you will build a console game that will let you exercise the skills and concepts you have learned in the unit so far. This game is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game.

Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to Pick a number between some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10". Their job is to make a guess, and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. Their next guess is based on what you've told them. If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.

To complete each part of this project, use ONLY the concepts and techniques we have covered in the courses so far.

## Grading
To get a passing grade you'll need to submit a project that meets the following requirements. If your project receives a "Needs Work" rating on any of these tasks, then you'll need to edit your project and re-submit it until it "Meets" or "Exceeds" each task requirement.

## Before You Start
To prepare for this project you'll need to make sure you complete and understand these steps.

(4 Steps)

    Have a GitHub account and know how to create a new repository as well as be able to upload files to it. If you need a reminder on how to use GitHub and GitHub desktop to create a new repository check out the workshop 'Share Your Projects wIth GitHub Desktop' in the Project Resources, or [the GitHub in Workspaces Workshop](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/github-in-workspaces).

    Fork the supplied [Number Guessing Game snapshot](https://w.trhou.se/o4jq14qr4k) into your own workspace.

    This Workspace Snapshot contains an initial Python script called guessing_game.py with some helpful additional comments.

    Read the instructions carefully - we suggest twice, at least.

    Fork the snapshot, you can also optionally download the zip files from the Workspace itself and work locally on your machine, if you would prefer. Choose File > Download Workspace

    You’ll certainly need your computer to complete the project, but you may want to begin by sketching out your ideas/code with a pencil and paper.

## Project Instructions
To complete this project, follow the instructions below. If you get stuck, ask a question on Slack or in the Treehouse Community.

(6 Steps)


    Make sure your script runs without errors. Catch exceptions and report errors to the user in a meaningful way.

    As a player of the game, I should see a some kind of text header, welcome or game intro message, before or above the menu.
    
    As a player of the game, I should be continuously prompted for a guess until I get it right.
    
    As a player of the game, after an incorrect guess I should be told if my answer is higher or lower than the answer, so that I can narrow down my guesses.
    
    As a player of the game, after the game ends I should be shown my number of attempts at guessing.
    
    Before you submit your project for review, make sure you can check off all of the items on the [Student Project Submission Checklist](Student-Project-Submission-Checklist.pdf). The checklist is designed to help you make sure you’ve met the grading requirements and that your project is complete and ready to be submitted!

## Extra Credit
To get an "exceeds" rating, you can expand on the project in the following ways:

(3 Steps)

1. As a player of the game, my guess should be within the number range. If my guess is outside the guessing range I should be told to try again.

1. As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.

1. As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points), so that I know what I am supposed to beat.

## NOTES


- The high score only needs to exist for as long as the game/script runs. When a player ends the game and relaunches the script, the high score will be reset again. (you DO NOT have to store the results to persist data between each script run).

- Always mention in the comments of your submission or resubmission, what grade you are going for. Some students want their project to be rejected if they do not meet all Exceeds Requirements, others will do all the exceeds and do not mind if they pass with a Meets Expectations grade. Leaving a comment in your submission will help the grader understand what you are attempting.

- Passing grades are final. If you try for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade, but miss an item and receive a “Meets Expectations” grade, you won’t get a second chance. Exceptions can be made for items that have been misgraded in review.

- To get an "Exceeds Expectations" grade for this project, you'll need to complete each of the items in this section. See the rubric in the "How You'll Be Graded" tab above for details on how you'll be graded.
